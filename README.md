# Jet
Jet (Jet-NGN) is a JavaScript UI library.

## How is Jet different from other UI libraries or frameworks?
Jet has a number of things in common with other modern libraries like React and Vue. It provides for declarative UI, it handles state updates automatically, and it even provides routing and permissions management out-of-the-box. However, it accomplishes these things in different, more efficient ways.

First of all, it does not make use of a Virtual DOM algorithm for DOM management. Instead, the majority of the DOM generated by Jet is static. The library enables the developer to identify eactly which parts of the DOM are dynamic, and it stores direct references to those elements. That means Jet can update those elements directly when state changes, without needing to diff the surrounding static DOM. This results in massive efficiency increases when rendering updates.

In addition, Jet's API is based on simple, Plain-Old-JavaScript-Object (POJSO) notation. There is no special syntax to learn, and Jet apps run natively in the browser, with no need for transpilation or bundling (although bundling certainly doesn't hurt).

Jet's developer tools provide all the information needed for debugging and troubleshooting.

Jet apps are also self-documenting.

Jet apps can even be made using a visual editor.
